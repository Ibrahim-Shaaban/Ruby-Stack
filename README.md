# Stack using Ruby

## Description

Implement a stack class and calculate maximum value and average on large number of data

## Instructions

### Stack has the following methods

- A public method called "push" that receives an unsigned integer number as parameter.
  This method should store the numbers internally while keeping the order they where
  pushed.
- A public method called "pop" that returns the previously "pushed" numbers in reversed
  order (FILO).
- A public method called "max" which returns the highest number of the numbers in the
  stack.

### Extras has the following methods

- It should expose a method called "mean" which should return the mean value (average value)

## Run the code

- Write you test cases in the run file
- run `<ruby run.rb>`
